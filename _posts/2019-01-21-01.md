#### 원글: [Stateless functional components and shouldComponentUpdate](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5677)

> There are discussions about having a pureRender flag that you could set on the function, or allowing it to participate in the shouldUpdate lifecycle, but that's currently not implemented. At the moment, stateless functions can not be pure-render.

> It is worth keeping in mind that sometimes people abuse/overuse pure-render; it can sometimes be as or more expensive than running the render again, because you're iterating over the array of props and potentially doing things like string compares, which is just extra work for components that ultimately return true and then proceed to rerender anyway. PureRender / shouldComponentUpdate really is considered an escape hatch for performance and is not necessarily something that should be blindly applied to every component.

요점은, stateless 컴포넌트에 pure-render 관련한 최적화는 구현되어있지 않다는 것이다. pure-render 혹은 shouldComponentUpdate 의 구현 내용이 오히려 퍼포먼스의 저하를 가져올 수도 있기 때문에, 컨트리뷰터들은 그것이 오남용되는 것을 지양하고 있다. (필요하면 필요한 사람이 선택적으로 사용/구현하면 된다.)

> Stateless functional components are useful for dumb/presentational components. Presentational components focus on the UI rather than behavior, so it’s important to avoid using state in presentational components. Instead, state should be managed by higher-level “container” components, or via Flux/Redux/etc. Stateless functional components don’t support state or lifecycle methods.

Stateless 컴포넌트는 state도 lifecycle도 없는, 보여주기만을 위한 컴포넌트(presentational component)이다. state 혹은 lifecycle이 필요하다면 higher-order component를 활용하면 된다.

> Update: With React 16.6+, you can declare “pure” functional components via React.memo. And with Hooks in 16.7, functional components transpile smaller too.

> Even today, functional components transpile down to less code than class components, which means functional components = smaller bundles:

React 16.6 에서 stateless 컴포넌트의 순수성을 위해 `React.memo`를 제공하며, 16.7 이상에서는 transpile 결과물도 class component 에 비해 더 간결하다.
